            <h2 class="text-centered">About Me</h2>
            <p class="text-centered">I've experience a few different walks of life from being a student at college, working in construction, fixing household appliances like televisions and computers,
            even working as a freelancer from time to time. Over these years I've found myself working with software that I wish I could understand and improve from a users perspective.
            I look forward to my journey of learning and understanding that comes from the experience I've gained and hope others can benefit from it too!</p>
            <p class="text-centered">So that's where my adventure starts at thinkful to become a software engineer.</p>
            <p class="text-centered">I am always looking for opportunities to work with people to build something that we can take pride in and enjoy challenging each other to become better developers.
            Please feel free to reach out, I look forward to working with you!</p>
